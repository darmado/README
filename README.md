**DR;TS**. I'm Self-taught, with 1ten years of hands-on work in TAO _(LATAM gov)_, adversary emulation, assumed breach, purple teaming, AppSec, and five years of security engineering and analyst work.

I like data-driven tools, frameworks, and projects that help teams solve problems with minimal effort. I lean more towards building tools that validate threat detection and response assumptions, **MTTD** and **MTTR**.
