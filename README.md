### üá∫üá∏ Adversary Emulation / Detection Engineering

 ## DR;TS
 What's good? Here's  DR;TS. I'm Self-taught, with 15 years in the field and a background in TAO (LATAM gov), adversary emulation, assumed breach, purple teaming, AppSec, security engineering, and analyst work.


## Opensource Philosophy
Give back to the security community without hidden attachments from a place of entitlement, self-imposed boundaries, or biased disposition. Build flexible, modular, interoperable tools that bolt onto ecosystems and are easy to maintain, deploy, and promote technical feedback loops with supporting evidence. Otherwise, your project creates more work for understaffed security teams that are overloaded and responsible for providing rock-star security with minimal support, tight budgets, compliance work, third-party vendor infiltration, and business risk. If you want to make an impact, build a project that solves common problems in a specific field. Kudos if you create tools that solve problems the community complains about; otherwise, it's a passion project. It's still cool in my book, though.

### Data-Driven Biases  
I like data, data-driven tools, frameworks, and projects that help teams hit milestones 10x faster with minimal effort. I lean more towards building tools that validate assumptions around threat detection and response, **MTTD**, **MTTR**, and the most recent acronym I may have coined `(jk)`, **MTTE**‚Äî"Mean Time To Execute," a technique that's publicly known, sourced from CTI, and relevant to an organization's tech stack, or operating systems. We'll see if it gains traction. :) 

### Promote Shared Innovation with ‚ù§Ô∏è
Open-source code is a tangled web of borrowed ideas that evolve into artistic product components. Embrace the ethos of shared innovation. Your code may end up in the hands of an engineer who repurposes your code to fit their needs, solve a problem at work, build on top of your work, or build a product, and that's okay. It's a form of embracing the ethos. If this resonates with you, develop your code under the Apache 2.0 license, a low-risk permissive license that protects against patent trolls. 

If the idea of shared innovation doesn't resonate, use the MIT license to avoid legal implications. Wait, there's more. Suppose some aspiring engineer is new to the industry, unaware of the legal consequences of open-source licenses, and repurposes your code to build a product that unintentionally infringes on patents. In this vanilla example, they're `f.*d` under the MIT license you included in your project. 

Help protect innovators, the community, and startups from patent trolls.  Use the Apache 2.0 License.
