## ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸  [OffensiveOps | Detection Engineering](https://x.com/darmad0)
Self-taught, with ten years of hands-on work in TAO _(LATAM gov)_, adversary emulation, assumed breach, purple teaming, AppSec, and five years of security engineering and analyst work.


I like to build flexible, modular, interoperable tools that bolt onto security tool ecosystems and are easy to maintain, deploy, and promote technical feedback loops.
