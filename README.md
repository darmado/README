### Promote Shared Innovation with ‚ù§Ô∏è
Open-source code is a tangled web of borrowed ideas that evolve into artistic product components. Embrace the ethos of shared innovation. Your code may end up in the hands of an engineer who repurposes your code to fit their needs, solve a problem at work, build on top of your work, or build a product, and that's okay. If this resonates with you, build projects under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), a low-risk permissive license that protects against patent trolls. 

If shared innovation doesn't resonate, use the[ MIT license](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39413562) to avoid legal implications. It's cool to wipe your hands clean from public work every now and then.  

Help protect innovators, the community, and startups from patent trolls.  Use the Apache 2.0 License.
